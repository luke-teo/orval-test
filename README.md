## Orval Test Project

This is a test repository to determine how [Orval](https://orval.dev/reference/configuration/overview) works with next.js.

Current implementation has defaulted to using `orval.config.js` as the configuration file. Generated files such as the `types.ts` or the respective dtos can be found within `generated/` directory.
